# Music-Projects

This repository contains music pieces that I have composed using Max, a visual programming language for music and multimedia, and JavaScript. I used Max for the first two pieces I composed that are titled "Project1" and "Project2" respectively in this repository. For the third piece, which is titled "Project3", I used the Tone.js and p5.js JavaScript libraries. I have had a lot of fun exploring these libraries and creating new sounds.
